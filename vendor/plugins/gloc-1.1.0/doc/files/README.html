      <h1>About</h1>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>
I originally started designing this on weekends and after work in 2005. We
started to become very interested in Rails at work and I wanted to get some
experience with ruby with before we started using it full-time. I
didn&#8217;t have very many ideas for anything interesting to create so,
because we write a lot of multilingual webapps at my company, I decided to
write a localization library. That way if my little hobby project developed
into something decent, I could at least put it to good use. And here we are
in 2006, my little hobby project has come a long way and become quite a
useful piece of software. Not only do I use it in production sites I write
at work, but I also prefer it to other existing alternatives. Therefore I
have decided to make it publicly available, and I hope that other
developers will find it useful too.
</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> is a localization library. It
doesn&#8217;t aim to do everything l10n-related that you can imagine, but
what it does, it does very well. It was originally designed as a Rails
plugin, but can also be used for plain ruby projects. Here are a list of
its main features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight and efficient.

</li>
<li>Uses file-based string bundles. Strings can also be set directly.

</li>
<li>Intelligent, cascading language configuration.

</li>
<li>Create flexible rules to handle issues such as pluralization.

</li>
<li>Includes a ActionController filter that auto-detects the client language.

</li>
<li>Works perfectly with Rails Engines and allows strings to be overridden just
as easily as controllers, models, etc.

</li>
<li>Automatically localizes Rails functions such as distance_in_minutes,
select_month etc

</li>
<li>Supports different charsets. You can even specify the encoding to use for
each language seperately.

</li>
<li>Special Rails mods/helpers.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> mean?</h3>
<p>
If you&#8217;re wondering about the name &quot;<a
href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a>&quot;, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re not
alone. This project was originally just called &quot;Localization&quot;
which was a bit too common, so when I decided to release it I decided to
call it &quot;Golly&#8217;s Localization Library&quot; instead (Golly is my
nickname), and that was long and boring so I then abbreviated that to
&quot;<a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a>&quot;. What a fun story!!
</p>
<h3>Localization helpers</h3>
<p>
This also includes a few helpers for common situations such as displaying
localized date, time, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, etc.
</p>
<h3>Rails Localization</h3>
<p>
At the moment, unless you manually remove the <tt>require
&#8216;gloc-rails-text&#8217;</tt> line from init.rb, this plugin overrides
certain Rails functions to provide multilingual versions. This
automatically localizes functions such as select_date(),
distance_of_time_in_words() and more&#8230; The strings can be found in
lang/*.yml. NOTE: This is not complete. Timezones and countries are not
currently localized.
</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<h3>Quickstart</h3>
<p>
Windows users will need to first install iconv. <a
href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/iconv">wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/iconv</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a dir &quot;#{RAILS_ROOT}/lang&quot;

</li>
<li>Create a file &quot;#{RAILS_ROOT}/lang/en.yml&quot; and write your strings.
The format is &quot;key: string&quot;. Save it as UTF-8. If you save it in
a different encoding, add a key called file_charset (eg.
&quot;file_charset: iso-2022-jp&quot;)

</li>
<li>Put the following in config/environment.rb and change the values as you see
fit. The following example is for an app that uses English and Japanese,
with Japanese being the default.

<pre>
  GLoc.set_config :default_language =&gt; :ja
  GLoc.clear_strings_except :en, :ja
  GLoc.set_kcode
  GLoc.load_localized_strings
</pre>
</li>
<li>Add &#8216;include <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a>&#8217; to all
classes that will use localization. This is added to most Rails classes
automatically.

</li>
<li>Optionally, you can set the language for models and controllers by simply
inserting <tt>set_language :en</tt> in classes and/or methods.

</li>
<li>To use localized strings, replace text such as <tt>&quot;Welcome&quot;</tt>
with <tt>l(:welcome_string_key)</tt>, and <tt>&quot;Hello
#{name}.&quot;</tt> with <tt>l(:hello_string_key, name)</tt>. (Of course
the strings will need to exist in your string bundle.)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is more functionality provided by this plugin, that is not
demonstrated above. Please read the API summary for details.
</p>
<h3>API summary</h3>
<p>
The following methods are added as both class methods and instance methods
to modules/classes that include <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a>.
They are also available as class methods of <a
href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a>.
</p>
<pre>
  current_language               # Returns the current language
  l(symbol, *arguments)          # Returns a localized string
  ll(lang, symbol, *arguments)   # Returns a localized string in a specific language
  ltry(possible_key)             # Returns a localized string if passed a Symbol, else returns the same argument passed
  lwr(symbol, *arguments)        # Uses the default rule to return a localized string.
  lwr_(rule, symbol, *arguments) # Uses a specified rule to return a localized string.
  l_has_string?(symbol)          # Checks if a localized string exists
  set_language(language)         # Sets the language for the current class or class instance
  set_language_if_valid(lang)    # Sets the current language if the language passed is a valid language
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> module also defines the
following class methods:
</p>
<pre>
  add_localized_strings(lang, symbol_hash, override=true) # Adds a hash of localized strings
  backup_state(clear=false)                               # Creates a backup of GLoc's internal state and optionally clears everything too
  clear_strings(*languages)                               # Removes localized strings from memory
  clear_strings_except(*languages)                        # Removes localized strings from memory except for those of certain specified languages
  get_charset(lang)                                       # Returns the charset used to store localized strings in memory
  get_config(key)                                         # Returns a GLoc configuration value (see below)
  load_localized_strings(dir=nil, override=true)          # Loads localized strings from all YML files in a given directory
  restore_state(state)                                    # Restores a backup of GLoc's internal state
  set_charset(new_charset, *langs)                        # Sets the charset used to internally store localized strings
  set_config(hash)                                        # Sets GLoc configuration values (see below)
  set_kcode(charset=nil)                                  # Sets the $KCODE global variable
  similar_language(language)                              # Tries to find a valid language that is similar to the argument passed
  valid_languages                                         # Returns an array of (currently) valid languages (ie. languages for which localized data exists)
  valid_language?(language)                               # Checks whether any localized strings are in memory for a given language
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> uses the following configuration
items. They can be accessed via <tt>get_config</tt> and
<tt>set_config</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
  :default_cookie_name
  :default_language
  :default_param_name
  :raise_string_not_found_errors
  :verbose
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> module is automatically
included in the following classes:
</p>
<pre>
  ActionController::Base
  ActionMailer::Base
  ActionView::Base
  ActionView::Helpers::InstanceTag
  ActiveRecord::Base
  ActiveRecord::Errors
  ApplicationHelper
  Test::Unit::TestCase
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> module also defines the
following controller filters:
</p>
<pre>
  autodetect_language_filter
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> also makes the following change to
Rails:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Views for ActionMailer are now #{view_name}_#{language}.rb rather than just
#{view_name}.rb

</li>
<li>All ActiveRecord validation class methods now accept a localized string key
(symbol) as a :message value.

</li>
<li><a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord/Errors.html#M000039">ActiveRecord::Errors.add</a>
now accepts symbols as valid message values. At runtime these symbols are
converted to localized strings using the current_language of the base
record.

</li>
<li><a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord/Errors.html#M000039">ActiveRecord::Errors.add</a>
now accepts arrays as arguments so that printf-style strings can be
generated at runtime. This also applies to the validates_* class methods.

<pre>
  Eg. validates_xxxxxx_of :name, :message =&gt; ['Your name must be at least %d characters.', MIN_LEN]
  Eg. validates_xxxxxx_of :name, :message =&gt; [:user_error_validation_name_too_short, MIN_LEN]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Instances of ActiveView inherit their current_language from the controller
(or mailer) creating them.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
This plugin also adds the following rake tasks:
</p>
<pre>
  * gloc:sort - Sorts the keys in the lang ymls (also accepts a DIR argument)
</pre>
<h3>Cascading language configuration</h3>
<p>
The language can be set at three levels:
</p>
<pre>
  1. The default     # GLoc.get_config :default_language
  2. Class level     # class A; set_language :de; end
  3. Instance level  # b= B.new; b.set_language :zh
</pre>
<p>
Instance level has the highest priority and the default has the lowest.
</p>
<p>
Because <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> is included at class level
too, it becomes easy to associate languages with contexts. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  class Student
    set_language :en
    def say_hello
      puts &quot;We say #{l :hello} but our teachers say #{Teacher.l :hello}&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are often situations when depending on the value of one or more
variables, the surrounding text changes. The most common case of this is
pluralization. Rather than hardcode these rules, they are completely
definable by the user so that the user can eaasily accomodate for more
complicated grammatical rules such as those found in Russian and Polish (or
so I hear). To define a rule, simply include a string in the string bundle
whose key begins with &quot;<em>gloc_rule</em>&quot; and then write ruby
code as the value. The ruby code will be converted to a Proc when the
string bundle is first read, and should return a prefix that will be
appended to the string key at runtime to point to a new string. Make sense?
Probably not&#8230; Please look at the following example and I am sure it
will all make sense.
</p>
<p>
Simple example (string bundle / en.yml)
</p>
<pre>
  _gloc_rule_default: ' |n| n==1 ? &quot;_single&quot; : &quot;_plural&quot; '
  man_count_plural: There are %d men.
  man_count_single: There is 1 man.
</pre>
<p>
Simple example (code)
</p>
<pre>
  lwr(:man_count, 1)  # =&gt; There is 1 man.
  lwr(:man_count, 8)  # =&gt; There are 8 men.
</pre>
<p>
To use rules other than the default simply call lwr_ instead of lwr, and
specify the rule.
</p>
<p>
Example 2 (string bundle / en.yml)
</p>
<pre>
  _gloc_rule_default: ' |n| n==1 ? &quot;_single&quot; : &quot;_plural&quot; '
  _gloc_rule_custom: ' |n| return &quot;_none&quot; if n==0; return &quot;_heaps&quot; if n&gt;100; n==1 ? &quot;_single&quot; : &quot;_plural&quot; '
  man_count_none: There are no men.
  man_count_heaps: There are heaps of men!!
  man_count_plural: There are %d men.
  man_count_single: There is 1 man.
</pre>
<p>
Example 2 (code)
</p>
<pre>
  lwr_(:custom, :man_count, 0)    # =&gt; There are no men.
  lwr_(:custom, :man_count, 1)    # =&gt; There is 1 man.
  lwr_(:custom, :man_count, 8)    # =&gt; There are 8 men.
  lwr_(:custom, :man_count, 150)  # =&gt; There are heaps of men!!
</pre>
<h3>Helpers</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> includes the following helpers:
</p>
<pre>
  l_age(age)             # Returns a localized version of an age. eg &quot;3 years old&quot;
  l_date(date)           # Returns a date in a localized format
  l_datetime(date)       # Returns a date+time in a localized format
  l_datetime_short(date) # Returns a date+time in a localized short format.
  l_lang_name(l,dl=nil)  # Returns the name of a language (you must supply your own strings)
  l_strftime(date,fmt)   # Formats a date/time in a localized format.
  l_time(date)           # Returns a time in a localized format
  l_YesNo(value)         # Returns localized string of &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; depending on the arg
  l_yesno(value)         # Returns localized string of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; depending on the arg
</pre>
<h3>Rails localization</h3>
<p>
Not all of Rails is covered but the following functions are:
</p>
<pre>
  distance_of_time_in_words
  select_day
  select_month
  select_year
  add_options
</pre>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h4>How do I use it in engines?</h4>
<p>
Simply put this in your init_engine.rb
</p>
<pre>
  GLoc.load_localized_strings File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__),'lang')
</pre>
<p>
That way your engines strings will be loaded when the engine is started.
Just simply make sure that you load your application strings after you
start your engines to safely override any engine strings.
</p>
<h4>Why am I getting an Iconv::IllegalSequence error when calling <a href="../classes/GLoc.html#M000013">GLoc.set_charset</a>?</h4>
<p>
By default <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> loads all of its default
strings at startup. For example, calling <tt>set_charset
&#8216;iso-2022-jp&#8217;</tt> will cause this error because Russian
strings are loaded by default, and the Russian strings use characters that
cannot be expressed in the ISO-2022-JP charset. Before calling
<tt>set_charset</tt> you should call <tt>clear_strings_except</tt> to
remove strings from any languages that you will not be using.
Alternatively, you can simply specify the language(s) as follows,
<tt>set_charset &#8216;iso-2022-jp&#8217;, :ja</tt>.
</p>
<h4>How do I make <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> ignore StringNotFoundErrors?</h4>
<p>
Disable it as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  GLoc.set_config :raise_string_not_found_errors =&gt; false
</pre>
